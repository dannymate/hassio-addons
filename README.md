Connect your devices into a single secure private WireGuard®-based mesh network with SSO/MFA and simple access controls.

## About

[NetBird][netbird] is an open-source VPN management platform built on top of WireGuard® making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

It requires zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

NetBird uses NAT traversal techniques to automatically create an overlay peer-to-peer network connecting machines regardless of location (home, office, data center, container, cloud, or edge environments and now HASSIO with this add-on), unifying virtual private network management experience.
