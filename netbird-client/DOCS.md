# Home Assistant Community Add-on: NetBird-Client

[NetBird][netbird] is an open-source VPN management platform built on top of WireGuardÂ® making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

It requires zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, VPN gateways, and so forth.

NetBird uses NAT traversal techniques to automatically create an overlay peer-to-peer network connecting machines regardless of location (home, office, data center, container, cloud, or edge environments and now HASSIO with this add-on), unifying virtual private network management experience.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. Add my Hass.io add-ons repository (**https://github.com/dannymate/hassio-addons**) to your Hass.io instance.
2. Install the "NetBird-Client" add-on.
3. If you are using the central NetBird instance you can either use the URL generated in the log or you can use a `SETUP_KEY`. If hosting your own then you'll want to set `ADMIN_URL` & `MANAGEMENT_URL` and again only need to set up the `SETUP_KEY` if you don't want to login via the log generated URL.
4. Start the "NetBird-Client" add-on.
5. Feels free to check the logs for `NetBird-Client` to make sure its booted correctly.
6. This client will show up in your NetBird dashboard.

## Configuration

You'll see the config file at `/config/netbird/config.json` after first boot.

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ADMIN_URL`

Admin Panel URL [http|https]://[host]:[port] (default "https://app.netbird.io")

Tells NetBird the URL through which you administrate your NetBird clients.
You'll find that the log generates a login URL you can use instead of configuring a `SETUP_KEY`. (If you're not already connected to a NetBird instance.)

### Option: `MANAGEMENT_URL`

Management Service URL [http|https]://[host]:[port] (default "https://api.wiretrustee.com:33073")

The client will use this URL to communicate with your NetBird instance api.

### Option: `SETUP_KEY`

Setup key obtained from the Management Service Dashboard (used to register peer)

This token is like a password for connecting your client to NetBird, you can leave this
option empty if you would prefer to login via a URL generated in the log with the `ADMIN_URL`.
